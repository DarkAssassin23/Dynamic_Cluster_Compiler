# Dynamic Cluster Compiler (DCC) Examples

## About
This is a collection of example projects that compile with
DCC. One thing to note is that, as far as source code goes, it is 
the same between the Unix and Windows examples. The only 
differences are the config files. Specifically, the
<code>distributed.cfg</code>, <code>mnt.cfg</code>, 
and <code>inventory.ini</code> files
